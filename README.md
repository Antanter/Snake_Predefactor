# Snake_Predefactor

a simulator of snake which likes apples.

it's going to be handled by one of there AI models (the one which will be the cheapest (china helllooo))

probably I'll add posibility for modes to play against each other - may be in score, may be in PVP (as worms.io)
nobody really knows

to run, clone the git repository and run ```cargo run```
